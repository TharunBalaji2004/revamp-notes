# Android Platform Architecture

Lets learn about how Android OS ðŸ“± was designed and developed by Google.

Android OS is an
- Mobile Operating System software
- Open source software
- **Linux-based** tech stack

## Android Tech Stack

### Linux Kernel
- Foundation of Android: The Linux kernel is the base of the Android platform.
- Key Functionalities: 
    - Supports threading and low-level memory management through the Android Runtime (ART).
- Security and Hardware Support:
    - Utilizes key security features of Linux.
    - Allows device manufacturers to develop hardware drivers for a familiar kernel.

### Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
- Purpose: Provides standard interfaces to expose device hardware capabilities to the higher-level Java API framework.
- Structure:
    - Each module implements an interface for specific hardware components (e.g., camera, Bluetooth).
- Operation: 
    - When a framework API calls to access hardware, the system loads the appropriate library module.

### Android Runtime (ART)
- Version: Used in devices running Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher.
- Process Management: Each app runs in its own process with its own instance of ART.
- Execution:
    - Executes Dalvik Executable format (DEX) files.
    - Optimized for minimal memory footprint.
    - Java sources compiled into DEX bytecode using tools like d8.
- Major Features:
    - Ahead-of-time (AOT) and just-in-time (JIT) compilation.
    - Optimized garbage collection (GC).
    - Conversion of DEX files to more compact machine code on Android 9 (API level 28) and higher.
    - Improved debugging support, including sampling profiler, detailed diagnostic exceptions, crash reporting, and watchpoints.
- Compatibility: Apps that run well on ART are likely to work on Dalvik, but not necessarily the reverse.

### Native C/C++ Libraries
- Core Components: Many Android system components and services, such as ART and HAL, are built using C and C++.
- Java Framework APIs: Provide access to functionality of some native libraries (e.g., OpenGL ES for 2D and 3D graphics).
- Android NDK: Allows apps to access native platform libraries directly if C or C++ code is required.

### Java API Framework
- Feature Set: The entire Android OS feature set is available through Java language APIs.
- Building Blocks: 
    - Simplifies reuse of core, modular system components and services:
    - Rich and extensible view system for UI components (lists, grids, text boxes, buttons, web browser).
    - Resource manager for non-code resources (localized strings, graphics, layout files).
    - Notification manager for custom alerts in the status bar.
    - Activity manager for managing app lifecycle and navigation.
    - Content providers for accessing or sharing data between apps.

### System Apps
- Core Apps: Includes email, SMS messaging, calendars, internet browsing, contacts, and more.
- Equal Status: 
    - System apps have no special status; third-party apps can replace them (e.g., default web browser, SMS messenger, keyboard).
- Developer Access:
    -  System apps provide key capabilities accessible from other apps (e.g., invoking an installed SMS app to send messages).

The origin of Android is that it was initially conceived as an operating system for digital cameras. When Andy Rubin, the co-founder of **Android Inc.**, and his team started working on the project in 2003, their original vision was to create an advanced operating system for **cameras**!
