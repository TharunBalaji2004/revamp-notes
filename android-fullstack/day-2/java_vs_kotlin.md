| Programming Language	| Kotlin |	Java |
| :----: | :-----: | :------: |
| **Null Safety** |	Kotlin has built-in null safety and No need for explicit null checks | Java objects can lead to null pointer exceptions if not properly checked. |
| **Code Quality** |	More concise | Requires more lines of code. | 
| **Smart Casts** |	Smart casts in Kotlin automatically handle type casting by the compiler |	Manual type casting is required |
| **Functional Programming** | Kotlin is a mix of object-oriented and functional programming. | Java is more limited to the concept of object-oriented programming. |
| **Coroutines Support** | Provides coroutines support which allow the developer to write code, suspend the execution and later resume it again. | Java enables the creation of multiple background threads when handling lengthy operations. |
| **Extension Functions** | Kotlin allows the developer to extend the functionality of classes without necessarily having to inherit from a class. | To extend the functionality of an existing class, one must create a new class and inherit the functions from the parent class. |
